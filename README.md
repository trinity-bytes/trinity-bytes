## About Me üéØ

As an aspiring Software Engineer, I'm driven by a profound passion for the **creativity and innovation** inherent in the world of code. For me, software is a boundless canvas, where every line is an opportunity to expand possibilities and **craft robust, elegant solutions from scratch**. I'm particularly excited about the **design and implementation of enterprise systems**, focusing on backend logic and building efficient applications, such as CRUD solutions with basic web integrations.

My approach to every challenge involves **thoroughly analyzing and understanding the problem**, then experimenting with various approaches until the most solid solution is found. This pursuit of robustness and continuous improvement is what truly motivates me. I've cultivated **perseverance and discipline** by breaking down complex challenges into manageable steps, learning that every small advance brings us closer to the final goal.

I am a **detail-oriented, curious, and self-taught** developer, always eager to expand my knowledge and apply new ideas. I deeply enjoy **teamwork** and value collaboration as a key tool for building something greater.

Currently, I'm actively seeking **internships** where I can apply my skills with C++ (my primary language, in which I have an intermediate/advanced academic proficiency) and foundational knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My goal is to immerse myself in a professional environment, contribute meaningful value, and learn from real-world experience to continue growing as an engineer.

## üé∂ Beyond Code & Engineering üì∏

When I'm not immersed in the world of software, my life is nourished by other passions that inspire and recharge me. **Music** is a fundamental part of who I am: as a member of my university's polyphonic choir, I enjoy the discipline and joy of team performances. My guitar is also a constant companion, allowing me to explore genres like jazz and bossa nova. **Photography** is another great hobby; each photo is a crafted memory, a way to collect and relive moments that remind me of the beauty in the world. These experiences, alongside engineering, make me feel truly alive and grateful for the endless possibilities life offers.
