## About Me üéØ

<img align="right" alt="Animated illustration of a person coding at a desk (looping GIF)" width="350" src=".github/assets/gifs/about-me-coding.gif">

As a passionate Software Engineering student, I'm driven by the **creativity and innovation** inherent in code. For me, software is a boundless canvas where every line expands possibilities and **crafts robust, elegant solutions from scratch**.

I specialize in **C++** (intermediate/advanced level) and focus on **enterprise systems design**, particularly backend logic and efficient applications like CRUD solutions with web integrations. My approach involves **thoroughly analyzing problems** and experimenting with various approaches until finding the most solid solution.

I'm a **detail-oriented, curious, and self-taught** developer who thrives on **teamwork** and collaboration. Currently, I'm actively seeking **internships** to apply my C++ expertise alongside my foundational knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in a professional environment.

## üé∂ Beyond Code & Engineering üì∏

When I'm not coding, I'm exploring other passions that fuel my creativity. As a member of my university's **polyphonic choir** and a **guitar enthusiast** (jazz & bossa nova), music brings discipline and joy to my life. **Photography** is another passion‚Äîeach shot is a crafted memory that reminds me of life's endless possibilities.

## üî• Highlights

- Strong C++ abstractions: data structures and algorithms from scratch (AVL, Hash, Heap, BST, linked lists).
- Product-thinking + systems design: layered architecture, clear separation of concerns, and console UI that feels intuitive.
- Practical graph work: topological sort (Kahn) and Hasse reduction with CSV/JSON exports and basic A11y.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Technical Skills

Core skills for C++ backend
- Strong: C++17, STL, DS/algorithms, RAII, file I/O, modular design.
- Solid: Patterns (MVC/Strategy/Factory), exceptions, MSVC/Visual Studio, Git.
- Basic: SQLite, JS/HTML/CSS, GitHub Actions, Linux fundamentals.

Here are the technologies I work with and am familiar with:
